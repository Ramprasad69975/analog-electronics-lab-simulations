LTspice simulations of analog electronics lab experiments as per Semester 3
## How to Open the Schematic

1. Download the `.asc` file in this repository.
2. Open it using [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) (free circuit simulator by Analog Devices).
3. You can simulate and analyze the waveform directly in LTspice.

If you don't have LTspice installed, download it [here](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
